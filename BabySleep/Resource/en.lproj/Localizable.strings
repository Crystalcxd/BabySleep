"noisetip" = "When babies leave their mother's womb, they come to a strange world that they have to adapt to. And some of these strange voices often make them feel uneasy and irritable. They tend to be used to noises in the womb.\nThe magic of white noise lies in their similar sound environment in the womb. It sounds like raining, waves lapping against the rock, or rustling leaves. If babies feel uneasy, they will come down when they heard the sound and fall asleep. It selects some pieces of white noise for new fathers and mothers to scientifically and effectively make their babies sleep, which can be also the auxiliary tool to soothe baby's mood.";
